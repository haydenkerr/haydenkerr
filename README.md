Hi 👋, I'm Hayden
I’m currently working on building up my GitHub profile with data analytics, scraping and integration projects.

🏭 I have worked in multiple industries over the past 15 years while continually learning.

👨‍💻 All of my data analytics projects are available at https://github.com/haydenkerr/data-analytics

💬 Ask me about anything analytics, documentation, compliance, data visualisation related, and I'll be happy to help you out. 

📫 Reach me LinkedIn. 

☕ When I am not learning, working or being a dad, I am probably standing at my coffee machine so that I can get back to learning, working and being a dad.
